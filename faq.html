									What is Travtail?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">
									At Travtail, we enable our customers to get access to daily essentials instantly or in less than 10 minutes. Using a marketplace model for convenience retail, our vision is to be the world's biggest retailer with almost no real estate (warehouses, fulfillment centers or physical stores). Our two main products are Travtail Intelligent Vending Machines and Travtail Marketplace (TravMart). TravMart enables anyone to start a convenience retail business without owning a physical store, warehouse or fulfillment center. If you own an existing physical convenience store, you can also sell on TravMart.<br><br>If you sell certain items via TravMart, you may be required to have a mini-warehouse or some other commercial location where you can pick and pack items.</p>
							</div>
								<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">

							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How many vending machines can I have?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">
									You can have as many vending machines as you need. If your short term rental property, rideshare, apartment complex, hotel or any other location gets a lot of traffic, we recommend putting our stores in multiple locations - we have stores of different sizes and shapes to accomodate the unique needs of each location. All stores are completely self-service - put the store anywhere and continue with your normal activities.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									Is it possible that the inventory shown in your mobile app isn't the same as the inventory in the machine? What happens if someone buys something and it turns out not to be physically available?
								</h2>
								<p align="left"> Our vending machines are designed such that only the products and units available in the physical vending machines can be purchased in our mobile application. We also track available units in real-time - a product will immediately not be available for purchase when the on-hand units are sold. When products are sold out, we immediately notify the vending machine owner and make it unpurchasable.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if someone accidentally grabs 2 items but paid for just 1 item? What happens if the customer puts the second item back?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">
									We account for these types of edge scenarios - customer selects one item and picks 2, customer selects two items and picks 1, customer's credit card is no longer active, customer takes one or more items and puts them back etc.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer puts an item in there that doesn’t belong or in the wrong section?
								</h2>
							<p align="left">If a customer puts items in the wrong section or puts an item that was never in the store, we will notify the store owner to place the item back in the right compartment or remove the item, and charge or penalize the customer as needed. Note that for most models, only the compartments with the product that the customer selects opens up. However, we know exactly where the item is and will charge any other customer that picks the item.</p>
									
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer misunderstands and pays for one item but thinks they paid for all the items they grabbed?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">In this case, the customer will be notified that they will be charged for all the items they grabbed. If the customer proceeds with the transaction, they will get charged. If they return the items (including putting the items in the wrong compartments), they will not be charged.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									6-10% commission sounds incredibly high
								</h2>
								<p align="left"> In general, the retail price for your products can be 2-10x the wholesale price and still be very competitiv. We will give you several pricing tools so you can price competitively. 6-10% is on the lower end of the commissions charged by other markeplace platforms. An extra monthly fee will apply if the vending machine owner wants theft, loss and damage (does not include product expiration) protection for the vending machine and its content. The 6% commission covers the cost of the commerce software (payments, inventory management, sales tax remittance, product recommendations engine, vending machine troubleshooting, customer support, market intelligence etc.).<br><br> In certain states, we can't take commissions on alcohol and/or tobacco sales - we will charge a monthly device and subscription fee in lieu of sales commmission. Note that all sellers will have access to age verification tools to sell age-limited items.
