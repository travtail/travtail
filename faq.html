							<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									How many vending machines can I have?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">
									You can have as many vending machines as you need. If your short term rental property, rideshare, apartment complex, hotel or any other location gets a lot of traffic, we recommend putting our stores in multiple locations - we have stores of different sizes and shapes to accomodate the unique needs of each location. All stores are completely self-service - put the store anywhere and continue with your normal activities.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									Is it possible that the inventory shown in your mobile app isn't the same as the inventory in the machine? What happens if someone buys something and it turns out not to be physically available?
								</h2>
								<p align="left"> Our vending machines are designed such that only the products and units available in the physical vending machines can be purchased in our mobile application. We also track available units in real-time - a product will immediately not be available for purchase when the on-hand units are sold. When products are sold out, we immediately notify the vending machine owner and make it unpurchasable.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if someone accidentally grabs 2 items but paid for just 1 item? What happens if the customer puts the second item back?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">
									We account for these types of edge scenarios - customer selects one item and picks 2, customer selects two items and picks 1, customer's credit card is no longer active, customer takes one or more items and puts them back etc.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer puts an item in there that doesn’t belong or in the wrong section?
								</h2>
							<p align="left">If a customer puts items in the wrong section or puts an item that was never in the store, we will notify the store owner to place the item back in the right compartment or remove the item, and charge or penalize the customer as needed. Note that for most models, only the compartments with the product that the customer selects opens up. However, we know exactly where the item is and will charge any other customer that picks the item.</p>
									
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									What if a customer misunderstands and pays for one item but thinks they paid for all the items they grabbed?
								</h2>
								<p align="left">In this case, the customer will be notified that they will be charged for all the items they grabbed. If the customer proceeds with the transaction, they will get charged. If they return the items (including putting the items in the wrong compartments), they will not be charged.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
									6-8% commission sounds incredibly high
								</h2>
								<p align="left"> In general, the retail price for your products can be 3-10x the wholesale price and still be very competitive. 6% is on the lower end of the commissions charged by other markeplace platforms. An extra 2% will apply if the vending machine owner wants theft, loss and damage (does not include product expiration) protection for the vending machine and its content. The 6% commission covers the cost of the commerce software (payments, inventory management, sales tax remittance, product recommendations engine, vending machine troubleshooting, customer support, market intelligence etc.). You can learn more ere: http://travtail.squarespace.com/).

						</div>
						<div class="single-faq">
								<h2 class="text-uppercase">
